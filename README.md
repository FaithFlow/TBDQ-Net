TBDQ-Net is a unified framework that integrates a frozen, pre-trained detector with a lightweight, learnable associator. It could achieve the high efficiency of decoupled architectures while maintaining the strong end-to-end tracking capability.

The code and pre-trained weights will be released upon organization and verification.
